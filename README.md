  Here I show my developments using React-Native. Most of them are studies that I developed at class (App Development). I started learning how to use Object-oriented programming (POO) in React Native to created a Calculator. Then I started using hooks and style sheet (Similar to CSS). My first app for real, It's 'meu perfil' that I use Flatlist and useContext to save the changes. However, in the next apps I had to make it save the data even if I close the app. So I learned how to use the data base and storage in the Firebase platform.
  My final test was a presentation called 'nr_11 SA'. I used in this app basically: Hooks (useState, useRef, useEffect, except useContext beacause I used Firebase), Style Sheets, Navigation, Hardware - Camera - Vibration and Firebase(data base and Storage). The apresentation had to be equal a someone who would have to sell it.
  
  I hope you find what you need in my git, Thank you so much.
